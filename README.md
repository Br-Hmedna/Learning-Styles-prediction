# A Predictive Model for the Identification of Learning Styles in MOOC Environments
The objective of this study is to predict learners’ learning styles based on their learning traces. 
# Dataset
The data used in this study were collected from an edX course entitled “Statistical Learning” conducted in Winter
2015 and Winter 2016 by the University of Stanford.The data were generously offered by the Center for Advanced
Research through Online Learning (CAROL). Data were anonymized to protect the privacy of students.
The course lasted nine weeks and consisted of lecture videos, problems and a discussion forum. Table

the overall architecture of our proposed method, consists of five main phases:
## Data collection:
The database of the current study were collected from an edX course entitled “Statistical Learning (Session Winter 2015 and Winter 2016)”, administered via Stanford’s Logunita platform. The sequential activities performed by each learner during each session were collected.
